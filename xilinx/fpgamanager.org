Once the kernel is booted and configured with a correct device-tree
blob, the FPGA can be updated with new bitstreams using the =fpgautil=
tool.

=fpgautil= and downloading from Linux requires to use the =bin= bitstream
format (file that contains only configuration data (it has no header
as the ".bit" file does).

Converting =bit= to =bin= files can be done using the =fpga-bit-to-bin.py=
tool available from several sources (see below). A version is included
in this repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./fpga-bit-to-bin.py -f virtual.bit virtual.bin
#+END_SRC

=fpgautil= requires root privileges to upload a configuration to the FPGA.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # fpgautil -b virtual.bin -f Full
#+END_SRC
